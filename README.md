# 2048-Game-in-Java-Console-Based-Implementation-with-Data-Structures
This repository features a console-based implementation of the popular '2048' game in Java, showcasing the usage of various data structures. The game involves merging numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to reach the 2048 tile.
The implementation showcases the usage of different data structures concepts, including linked lists, stacks, hash maps, and recursion. Singly-linked lists are employed to manage empty locations on the grid and shuffle tiles, while stacks are utilized for score tracking and undo functionality. Hash maps store customizable gaming keys, allowing players to tailor the game controls to their preferences. Recursion is employed for merging tiles and generating random tile values.

This project offers an interactive and challenging gaming experience, complete with score tracking, customizable controls, and undo functionality. By exploring the source code and understanding the data structures employed, developers can gain insights into the practical implementation of these concepts.

Feel free to explore the code and enhance it further to add new features or optimize the gameplay. Have fun playing and learning from this Java implementation of the 2048 game!
